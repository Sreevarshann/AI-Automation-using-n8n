## üéÆ Demo


Watch our system in action as it:
1. Receives a customer email inquiring about order tracking and refund policies
2. Processes the content to understand customer intent
3. Retrieves relevant information from the vector database
4. Generates a personalized, accurate response
5. Delivers the response through multiple channels

## ‚ú® Features

- **Email Trigger Automation**: Automatically captures and processes incoming support emails
- **AI-Powered Content Analysis**: Understands customer queries regardless of phrasing or language style
- **Semantic Knowledge Retrieval**: Uses vector embeddings to find the most relevant information
- **Dynamic Response Generation**: Creates personalized, contextually appropriate responses
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Delivers responses via email, with optional Telegram integration

## üì• Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-support-automation.git
cd ai-support-automation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- N8N instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- OpenAI API access
- Pinecone account and API key
- Gmail account with API access enabled

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Configuration


The system uses N8N workflows that need to be imported and configured:

1. **Email Monitoring Workflow**
   - Import `email-trigger.json` into your N8N instance
   - Configure Gmail credentials
   - Set up the message filtering criteria

2. **Content Analysis Workflow**
   - Import `content-analysis.json`
   - Connect to your OpenAI account
   - Define classification rules

3. **Response Generation Workflow**
   - Import `response-generation.json`
   - Configure templates and signature
   - Set up delivery channels

## üóÑÔ∏è Vector Store Setup

```javascript
// Example code for initializing Pinecone
const { Pinecone } = require('@pinecone-database/pinecone');

const pinecone = new Pinecone({
  apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY,
  environment: process.env.PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT,
});

// Create an index for storing support documentation
async function createSupportIndex() {
  try {
    const index = await pinecone.createIndex({
      name: 'customer-support',
      dimension: 1536,
      metric: 'cosine',
    });
    
    console.log('Index created successfully:', index);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating index:', error);
  }
}
```

### Document Preparation

1. Collect all support documents, FAQs, and policy information
2. Process and chunk documents into appropriate segments
3. Generate embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model
4. Upload embeddings to Pinecone using the provided scripts:

```bash
# Process and upload documents
node scripts/upload-documents.js --directory ./docs
```

## üß† AI Model Integration

The system uses several AI models for different purposes:

1. **Classification Model**: Determines if an email is support-related
   ```javascript
   // Example classification code
   async function classifyEmail(emailContent) {
     const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
       model: "gpt-4o-mini",
       messages: [
         { role: "system", content: "Analyze the content and determine if this is a customer support request." },
         { role: "user", content: emailContent }
       ],
     });
     
     return completion.choices[0].message.content;
   }
   ```

2. **Response Generation Model**: Creates personalized replies
   ```javascript
   // Example response generation
   async function generateResponse(query, relevantDocs) {
     const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
       model: "gpt-4o-mini",
       messages: [
         { 
           role: "system", 
           content: "You are a helpful customer support agent. Use the provided documentation to answer the customer's question accurately." 
         },
         { role: "user", content: `Customer question: ${query}\n\nRelevant information: ${relevantDocs.join('\n\n')}` }
       ],
     });
     
     return completion.choices[0].message.content;
   }
   ```

### Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts to ensure responses are:

- Professional and friendly
- Factually accurate
- Complete (addressing all parts of the query)
- Compliant with company policies
